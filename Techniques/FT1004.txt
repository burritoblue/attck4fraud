Fraud Technique: ATM Shimming
Fraud Tactic: Initiation
ID: FT1004
Version: 0.1

Description:
ATM Shimming refers to the act of capturing a bank card data accessing the EMV chip installed on the card while presenting the card to a ATM. Due to their low profile, shimmers can be fit inside ATM card readers and are therefore more difficult to detect.

Examples:
Shimmer device found inside a Diebold Opteva 520 [1]
Shimmer installed inside point-of-sale terminals at Coquitlam [2]

Mitigation:
Cover the numerical input pad while entering the PIN (customer); Avoid self-standing ATMs in isolated areas (customer); Anti-skimming technology: metal detection for card readers, card jitter motion (enterprise); verification of transaction using the codes generated by the EMV chip (enterprise).

Detection:
Inspection of motorised card slot for the presence of unrecognised devices; Visual evidence of tampering with the ATM.
