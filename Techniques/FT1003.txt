ATM Skimming is often achieved with a combination of a skimmer device for the card and a camera to capture the PIN.

Examples:
Insert skimmer; Deep-insert skimmer; overlay pad skimmer; Green skimmer; wiretapping.

Mitigation:
Anti-skimming technology: metal detection for card readers, card jitter motion (enterprise). Cover the numerical input pad while entering the PIN (customer); Avoid self-standing ATMs in isolated areas (customer); Chip installed on bank cards (enterprise).

Detection:
Anti-skimming technology: metal detection for card readers, card jitter motion. Visual evidence of tampering with the ATM; comparison to nearby ATMs of the same manufacturer and model; Presence of hidden cameras in the ATM fascia or near the PIN pad.
