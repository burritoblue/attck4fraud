Description:
In the context of ATT&CK for Fraud, phishing is described as the sending of fraudulent emails to a large audience in order to obtain sensitive information (PII, credentials, payment information). Phishing is never targeted to a specific individual or organisation. Phishing tries to create a sense of urgency or curiosity in order to capture the victim.

Examples:
Phishing messages were sent to Amazon users posing as the Amazon customer support [1] 
Fake Apple invoices were sent to Apple App Store customers in order to obtain their Apple ID credentials [2]

Mitigation:
Implementation of DKIM and SPF authentication to detected spoofed email senders; anti-phishing solutions.

Detection:
Email sender is spoofed; Email sender belongs to a domain recently created; Presence of typos or poor grammar in the email text; The request in the mail is unsolicited and creates urgency; No recollection of the subject or the sender of the phishing email; Request for credentials; Presence of a suspicious URL or attachment.
